This is the first Excel project I worked on in which I transformed the dataset, created pivot tables and created visualisations. 
In this dataset I looked at who buys the bikes, where they are located, their relationshp status,their age, gender and their level of education.
This project gave me an insight on who is our main target market and areas where improvement is needed.
